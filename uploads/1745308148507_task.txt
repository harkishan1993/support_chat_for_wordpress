1) create two javascript file then write a function in one file so how to access that function in other file without import and export file.;

2) create two html file (index.html and iframe.html).;
   in index.html file create an input box and submit button.;
   iframe.html must be shown as iframe in index.html with 500px width and height.;
   when any value is filled in input box then submit button is clicked so that value should be shown in iframe.;

3) create your own function such like push and pop function of javacript;
   and it should work as it is same like push and pop;

for example :

your custom function name is customPush

 var a = [1, 2, 6, 7];

     a.customPush(9);
   
     console.log(a); e.g [1,2,6,7,9]

your custom function name is customPop

 var a = [1, 2, 6, 7];

     a.customPop(9);
   
     console.log(a); e.g [1,2,6];

4) create one function that it takes unlimited argument(only number) and gives me sum of all number (without spread operator and with spread operator);

for example;

sum(1,2,3) result 6;
sum(2,3,1,3,4,6,10,2) result 31;

5) create a function such like following example;

  let c = [6,6,6,6] let a = [3,3,3], let b = [7,1,4,5,6,7,2,4,7,9,0,4,6,8,9,3,4,4,7] ;

 findHighSeries(a, b) e.g [4,4,4];
findHighSeries(c, b) e.g [7,7,7,7];
